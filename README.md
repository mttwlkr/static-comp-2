# Matt Walker || 1/2/2018 || Static-Comp-2:

#### I designed a travel deals app for static comp two. I used the following reasoning for the pallette, layout and responsiveness;

#### Travel is, supposed to be, light and fun, so I wanted a bright color scheme. I found a travel SVG pack that had a nice reds, blues and yellows that I used for icons and hover states. I wanted the photos to be the focal point of the site, so I picked colorful photos of each destination and then used a gradient from the photo back to a constant dark blue from the header.

#### I also am not sure about the responsive upper left header, I like it on all layouts but 4k, but I'll see what the teachers think.
